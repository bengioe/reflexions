As we all know the universe is made of [turtles](?as=cute).

But another more interesting thought I had recently is this:

Imagine for a moment that all universes exist (in the sense of an uncountably large infinite number of universes). We'll also have to assume that they are all deterministic (and that the apparent quantum fluctuations we observe are due to our limited ability to measure the entire state of the universe).

The universe in which we are seems to have this weird property where the laws of physics are the same everywhere. A priori there is no good reason for this.

Here I introduce a movie analogy. Imagine there is a finite quantity of information within each universe, thus each universe is a kind of movie that is being played; a "movie" being simply an arrangement of particles at every given moment.

Now it seems that we are in a particularly rare universe. If all movies of all arrangements of particles exist, then with high probability we should be in a universe that is just random noise. (In images random structure-less noise dominates the volume of all possible images, "natural" images are but a tiny volume).

If these noise universes exist then, by chance, sentient things (us presumably) should be able to pop in and out of existence and notice they are in a noisy world. Sentient things will be in a "stable" universe with infinitesimal probability.

Yet, here we are.

As such, I posit that all these configurations of random particules do not exist, i.e. not all universe-movies exist. That means that there is a manifold of universe configurations (with at least one point, our universe) that emerge from some laws of physics.

Thus, I subscribe to the laws of physics and our natural material universe.
