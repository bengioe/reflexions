This could be measured through reconstruction error, $H = f(X)$, $r = \\|X - f^{-1}(f(X))\\|$.</p>\n\n<p>If we naively minimize $r$, and there are a lot ($N_0$) of \"easy\" examples for which $r = \\epsilon$ but very few $n_0$ hard examples for which $r = \\alpha &gt;&gt; 0$ then the optimal function approximator may choose the parameters for which $\\epsilon N_0 + \\alpha n_0$ is minimal.</p>\n\n<p>We (I) don't know how neural networks \"attribute capacity\" to their inputs, or if this analogy is even useful, but let's suppose it is.</p>\n\n<p>What would happen if instead of minimizing error we minimize the maximal error?
